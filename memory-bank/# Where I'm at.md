# Where I'm at
Creating additional waking videos (not a priority, but may want to finish the current round)
- Kicked off a Sora gen from asleep still to awake neutral still
- Evaluate if this was a good approach
- may need to add short video clips to force Sora (instead of still images)

# Next steps
- Get into Sage's acutual functionality
- Improve her ability to respond to questions outside her functionality (use Bedrock to answer)
